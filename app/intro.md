**AirPlan 2.0** is a web-based airline planning App, advanced from previous AirPlan and Flight Delay. We visualize complex historical data on the airline industry into useful information to better educate our users as well as facilitate their decision-making. 

* Interactive Map: By choosing the departure city, users can easily find out the destination where they are able to reach by a single flight.

* Fares: Users can get a rough idea about how one-way ticket would be priced around on a particular route. They can know about the dominant carrier(s) and the cheapest carrier(s) by reviewing the Gantt Chart. 

* On-time Performance: Information on delay is categorized by airlines and by airports. The Bubble Plot allows the user to compare the performance of different airlines. The Delay Status on Map visualizes delay causes corresponding to locations. 

* Accident: Users can learn about accident statistics over the past 40 years at both states and national level. They are also informed with the safety level according to airlines and aircraft types.  

* Customer Satisfaction: Missing baggage, customer complaint, involuntary permillage, and all denied boarding are selected to evaluate customer satisfication among 12 major airlines.

* Suit Your Needs: Summary derived from former analysis helps users to choose the 'best' airline. Users can add weights to the criteria based on their own preference, which makes the selection better suit their needs.
